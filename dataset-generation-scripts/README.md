# Vietnames Provinces Database Dataset Automation Scripts

Vietnamese Government will gradually issue new decree to make change to the administrative units. The change is vary: promoting ward to a higher administrative unit, merging ward, etc...  
Therefore, it's challenging to keep the dataset up-to-date. Before the development of this automation scripts, I have to manually read the decree change and compare it with the new xls sheet (which is kind of dumb and counter-productive way üôà)  
Then it finally come to the development of this autogenerated patch script to make this repository maintainers's life easy.

## How does it work

The scripts are divided into two main phrases

- `dumper.go`: Read the administrative unit in CSV format, perform data transformation and insert the records into a temporary Postgres database  
- `patch_writer.go`: Read from the persisted temporary Postgres database, and generate insert records scripts for all 3 kinds of databases (MySQL/Postgres, SQL Server and Oracle)  
## How to run
### Prerequisite
You must have these thing installed on your machine
- Postgresql
- Go
### Setting thing up
You will need to create a temporary database in Postgres named `vn_provinces_tmp`. And provide the access credential in the connection string in `common/postgres_connector.go`

```golang
func GetPostgresDBConnection() *bun.DB {
	dsn := "postgres://postgres:root@localhost:5432/vn_provinces_tmp?sslmode=disable"
	sqlDB := sql.OpenDB(pgdriver.NewConnector(pgdriver.WithDSN(dsn)))
	db := bun.NewDB(sqlDB, pgdialect.New())
	return db
}
```
