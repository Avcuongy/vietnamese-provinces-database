# Vietnames Provinces Database Dataset Automation Scripts

Vietnamese Government will gradually issue new decree to make change to the administrative units. The change is vary: promoting ward to a higher administrative unit, merging ward, etc...  
Therefore, it's challenging to keep the dataset up-to-date. Before the development of this automation scripts, I have to manually read the decree change and compare it with the new xls sheet (which is kind of dumb and counter-productive way 🙈)  
Then it finally come to the development of this autogenerated patch script to make this repository maintainers's life easy.

## How does it work

The scripts are divided into two main phrases

- `dumper.go`: Read the administrative unit in CSV format, perform data transformation and insert the records into a temporary Postgres database  
- `patch_writer.go`: Read from the persisted temporary Postgres database, and generate insert records scripts for all 3 kinds of databases (MySQL/Postgres, SQL Server and Oracle)
